# vulnerabilityscanner
This is a small project (not finished yet) for scanning web vulnerabilities, written in python.

The target url used for my vulnerability scanner is from metasploitable2 box: "dvwa".

This script basically get as an argument the target url: "-u <url>" and returns a kinda repport as an output, for the moment the vulnerability that can be scanned is 'XSS'. 
  
To run the script: "python3 ./vulnerability_scanner -u <url>"

Looking forward to add more scan options, so feel free to contribute.
