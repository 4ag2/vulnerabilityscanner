# Vulnerability Scanner
This is a small project (still under developpement) for scanning web vulnerabilities, written in python.

The target url used for my vulnerability scanner is from metasploitable2 box: "dvwa". You should test it with metasploitable2. 

This script basically get as an argument the target url: "-u/--url <url>" and returns a kinda repport as an output, for the moment the vulnerability that can be scanned is 'XSS'. 

To run the script, you can run the help command -h/--help or simply run it as follow: 

"python3 ./vulnerability_scanner -u < target_url >"

Looking forward to add more scanners, so feel free to contribute I would be really appeciative. Thank you.
